INSTALLATION

  First of all you need perl <www.perl.org>, it is very likely this is allready
  on your system. Zoidberg is tested for perl version 5.8.2, but you are welcome 
  to file bug reports for other versions also.
  
  Modules which are not in the Zoidberg package but are depended upon by 
  Zoidberg are listed in the file "m/Depends.pd" -- these modules are available 
  from CPAN <http://cpan.org>.

  Below the 'configure' script is used, this is identical with 
  'perl Makefile.PL'.

 To install the package type:
   > ./configure && make all

 If you are missing dependencies try:
   > make installdeps

 To install the Zoidberg package from CPAN you can try:
   > perl -MCPAN -e shell
   CPAN> install Zoidberg

INSTALLATION OPTIONS

 For a complete list of make options type:
   > ./configure --help

 Allthough options are variabels that can be set for the 'make' command
 it is best to set them as switches with the 'configure' script;

 Note that the LIB_DIR var overloads the INSTALLDIRS var. Also the place where
 libraries and their man pages are installed is _not_ influenced by PREFIX, 
 but depends on your perl installation; use LIB_DIR and MAN_DIR to install 
 them in a non-default directory.

 To install all files in one dir, for example to make a install in your home
 dir when you don't have root privileges, try something like:
   > ./configure --appdir=/home/zoid
