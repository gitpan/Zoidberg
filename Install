INSTALLATION

  First of all you need perl <www.perl.com>,
  it is very likely this is allready on your system.
  Zoidberg is tested for perl versions 5.8.0 and 5.6.1,
  if you encounter bugs with other perl versions please
  add this information to your bug report.
  
  Modules which are not in the Zoidberg package but are depended upon
  by Zoidberg are listed in the file "m/Depends.pd" -- these modules
  are available from CPAN <http://cpan.org>

 To install the package type:
   > perl Makefile.PL
   > make all

 To install dependencies from CPAN try:
   > perl Makefile.PL
   > make installdeps

 For advanced installation options type:
   > perl Makefile.PL
   > make help

 To install packages from CPAN try for example:
   > perl -MCPAN -e shell
   CPAN> install Zoidberg

  Due to the modular design of Zoidberg it isn't necesary to use 
  all Zoidberg modules. Especially those in the 'Fish' namespace 
  are considered plugins. Be aware though that some plugins provide
  functionality which is vital to the (default) interface.

  The following plugins contain core functionality:
    Zoidberg::Fish::Buffer
    Zoidberg::Fish::Intel
    Zoidberg::Fish::Prompt
    Zoidberg::Fish::Commands
    Zoidberg::Fish::History

INSTALLATION OPTIONS

 Try :
   > perl Makefile.PL --help

  The LIB_DIR var overloads the INSTALLDIRS var.  
  The place where libraries and man pages are installed is 
  _NOT_ influenced by PREFIX - use LIB_DIR and MAN_DIR for that.

 For a private installation, try :
   > perl Makefile.PL APPDIR=private_dir

 FIXME
  	- prefix, lib_prefix, man_dir doc_dir & other vars 
	- local_dir

CONFIGURATION

  See ~/.zoid/ and /etc/zoidrc

  FIXME
  	As soon as config is stable
