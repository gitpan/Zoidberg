 Zoidberg - a modular perl shell, version 0.42
===============================================

 http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net
 
  Zoidberg provides a modular Perl shell written, configured, and operated 
  entirely in Perl. It aspires to be a fully operational login shell with all 
  the features one normally expects. But it also gives direct access to Perl 
  objects and data structures from the command line, and allows you to run Perl 
  code within the scope of your commandline.

INSTALLATION

  See the 'Install' file

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

  Visit the web page to submit bug reports or mail the author.
  Known bugs are listed in the BUGS file.

  Currently we test with perl 5.8.2 and perl 5.6.2. 
  Please _do_ bug report for other  perl versions.

  The Zoidberg shell is being developed for GNU/Linux, but should also run on
  other flavours of unix. Please _do_ bug report for other operatings systems.
