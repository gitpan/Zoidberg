 Zoidberg - a modular perl shell, version 0.1b
===============================================

** Laziness, Impatience, Hubris ! **

 http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net

  Zoidberg provides a shell written in perl, configured in perl and operated in perl.
  It is intended to be a replacement for bash in the future, but that is a long way.
  Most likely you will have to be a perl programmer or developer to enjoy this.

 Features include:
        runs perl from shell prompt (duh!)
        config in perl code
        perl codable prompt
        perl codable key bindings
        runtime loadable modules
        regex tab expansion (this is not a bug !)
        tab expansion through your perl data structure
        tab expansion for methods of loaded modules
                use this shell as your debug environment :)
        multi line editing
        help system
        pipes        (unstable)

 planned:
        jobs
        screen
        inter user communication
        wrappers for several CPAN modules like mailbox

INSTALLATION

  To use Zoidberg you most likely want both the package of
  perl modules (Zoidberg) and the package of program files
  (ProgramFiles). This last package provides you with a default
  config and a runnable script.
  The modules also are available on CPAN.

 To install the perl modules type:

   > perl Makefile.PL
   > make
   > make test
   > make install

 To install the perl modules from CPAN try:

   > perl -MCPAN -e 'install Zoidberg'

 To install the program files just run install.pl .

DEPENDENCIES

  First of all you need perl <www.perl.com>,
  it is very likely this is allready on your system.
  Zoidberg is tested for perl version  5.8.0 and 5.6.1 .

  Most likely the Zoidberg shell won't function properly
  on any other platform then GNU/Linux.
  It is not (yet) (really) POSIX compliant.

  It is adviced to installes all Zoidberg modules, although
  most are removable, it will be less fun.

    Allways necessary are:
       Zoidberg
       Zoidberg::PdParse
       Zoidberg::StringParse

    The following contain core functionality:
       Zoidberg::Buffer
       Zoidberg::Intel
       Zoidberg::Prompt
       Zoidberg::Commands
       Zoidberg::History

  Modules which are not in the Zoidberg package but are needed to install
  Zoidberg are listed in the Depends.pd file -- these modules are available
  from CPAN <http://cpan.org>.
