zoidfaq - Frequently Asked Questions for Zoidberg

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head2 About the project

=head3 What's with the name ?

If you don't know where the name comes from, you should watch more cartoons.

Quoting some futurama episode about a certain docter Zoidberg :

 "He's a weird monster who smells
     like he eats garbage and does"

This program was from the very beginning intended to become a huge and bloated monster.

=head3 Is it stable yet ?

B<NO !> If it is stable we'll call it 1.00 .
Currently we are working towards a 0.50 release that will be the first candidate
for a stable version.

=head3 Is it safe to use it already ?

Kind of, as long as you don't try too fancy stuff with too many privileges.


=head2 Features

=head3 How do I turn off ansi colours ?

Set the environment variable CLICOLOR to 0 (null).

=head3 What's with the single arrow ?

When you type perl code without brackets around it, zoid does a little source filtering making a arrow 'C<< -> >>' (the dereference operator) at the start of a word an alias for 'C<< $shell-> >>'. Where 'C<< $shell >>' is the main shell object. 

 zoid$ ->Commands->cd(q/../)
 # is the same as
 zoid$ $shell->Commands->cd(q/../)


=head2 Errors

=head3 I upgraded to a new version of zoid and it crash immediately !?

If you have all dependencies right you probably need to remove 
either the directory C<< ~/.zoid >> or the file C<< ~/.cache/zoid_path_cache >>.

=head3 I got a segfault after using perl syntax, is this a bug ?

Well, if it _is_ a bug then probably it's a bug in perl, not in zoid.
Most notoriously if you use globs in perl code, perl 5.8.0 can segfault;
upgrading to perl 5.8.2 fixes this problem.
