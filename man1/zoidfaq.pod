zoidfaq - Frequently Asked Questions about Zoidberg

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head2 About the project

=head3 What's with the name ?

If you don't know where the name comes from, you should watch more cartoons.

Quoting some futurama episode about a certain docter Zoidberg :

 "He's a weird monster who smells
     like he eats garbage and does"

This program was from the very beginning intended to become a huge and bloated monster.

=head3 Is it stable yet ?

B<NO !> If it is stable we'll call it 1.00 .

=head3 Is it safe to use it already ?

Kind of, as long as you don't try too fancy stuff with too many privileges.


=head2 Features

=head3 How do I turn off ansi colours ?

Set the environment variable CLICOLOR to 0 (null).

=head3 What's with the single arrow syntax ?

When you type perl code without brackets around it, zoid does a little source filtering making a arrow 'C<< -> >>' (the dereference operator) at the start of a word an alias for 'C<< $shell-> >>'. Where 'C<< $shell >>' is the main shell object. 

 zoid$ ->Commands->cd(q/../)
 # is the same as
 zoid$ $shell->Commands->cd(q/../)

=head3 I dislike jobs ending without waiting for me to hit a key :(

This behaviour is called asynchronous notification.
It is not a real default option; it is turned on in the default 'zoidrc' file.
Remove the setting "notify" from our 'zoidrc' file or try C<< set +o notify >>.

=head3 Does zoid have a "RPROMPT" ?

No, but Term::ReadLine::Zoid does :)
If you use this module try setting C<< $ENV{RPS1} >>.

=head3 I miss feature X, every shell should have feature X !

Probably it's on the TODO list, or at some list at least.
Try the mailing list.


=head2 Errors

=head3 I upgraded to a new version of zoid and it crash immediately !?

If you have all dependencies right you probably need to remove 
either the directory C<< ~/.zoid >> or the file C<< ~/.cache/zoid_path_cache >>.

Also it might be a good idea to clean up C<< /usr/share/zoid >> and/or
C<< /usr/local/share/zoid >> before installing a new version.

=head3 I upgraded to a new version of zoid and it hangs !

See the previous question.

=head3 I got a segfault after using perl syntax, is this a bug ?

Well, if it _is_ a bug then probably it's a bug in perl, not in zoid.
Most notoriously if you use globs in perl code, perl 5.8.0 can segfault;
upgrading to perl 5.8.2 fixes this problem.


=head2 Development

=head3 How do I get Zoid to cooperate with a gui toolkit like Tk ?

To my understanding the only thing needed to cooperate with any gui
toolkit is a "heartbeat" event to update the gui. If you use our
Term::ReadLine::Zoid library zoid will give you an event called "beat".
Try something like:

 $shell->{events}{beat} = \&update_gui;
