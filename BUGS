__BUGS__

See pipeline from STDIN problem in t/90_something.t

perl code containing stuff like q/}/ will make StringParser trow an error

Help.pm is broken -- share/zoid/help ==> share/doc/zoid/pod

C<forw> == C<{ cd('->') }> seems to be buggy

.pd files can't loop or use each other

color off (fixed by stringformat ? ) - make this Zoidberg::Output

source scripts can pollute each others namespace

fluff
	C< zoid --command=ls > should wait for child processes / jobs

History
	A literal "\n" vanishes after re-reading history

Buffer
	Buffer tends to overwrite the last line if it didn't end with a \n -- do we really need a seperate process to capture STDOUT to fix this :(( ??


Intel:  
        expansie in multi line gaat fout (?)
	expansie over de regel breedte gaat soms fout
	
	[pardus@Captain moviez] mplayer The.Matrix.Reloaded.TS.REAL.PROPER-APM/CD*/<TAB>
	Buffer died. 
	Can't use an undefined value as an ARRAY reference at /home/pardus/local_zoid//lib/Zoidberg/Fish/Intel.pm line 58.

	when expanding subroutines of class Zoidberg they get wrong postfixes
