----

* Pipeline from STDIN problem, see t/90_full.t
When zoid runs in non-interactive mode and gets its commands from
STDIN, it can happen that when a command is a pipeline some child processes keep listening to the parents STDIN after they should have been terminated.

* perl code containing stuff like q/}/ can make StringParser trow an error because StringParser doesn't recognise q// as quoting.

* Source scripts can pollute each others namespace.
In theory 'do filename' should create a clean namespace 'main' for each script, but do to a bug in perl versions older then 5.8.1 we can't use this construct. Thus all scripts are in the namespace 'Main' that isn't cleaned.

* A literal '\n' vanishes after re-reading history

* The Buffer tends to overwrite the last line if it didn't end with a "\n"

* When you use a built-in command as a perl-routine, the capturing of STDOUT doesn't work
