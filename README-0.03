Zoidberg version 0.03
=====================

http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net


Zoidberg basicly provides a shell written in perl
(i know, yet another ...). It is intended to be a
replacement for bash in the future.

Features include:
        runs perl from shell prompt (duh!)
        config in perl code
        perl codable prompt
        perl codable key bindings
        runtime loadable modules
        regex tab expansion (this is not a bug !)
	tab expansion for methods of loaded modules ... use this shell as your debug environment :)
	multi line editing
	help system

planned:
        pipes                           (very soon)
        jobs
        screen
        inter user communication
        wrappers for several CPAN modules like mailbox

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation will be provided once the basic functionality
is stable. For now check the default config.

INSTALLATION

To install Zoidberg run:

   install.pl

The installer also tries to install the perl modules,
this must be done as root.
If the installer failes check whether you have all
required perl modules.

To install the perl modules type:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



DEPENDENCIES

First of all you need perl <www.perl.com>, this is very likely
to be allready on your system.

Further more the following perl modules are required,
they are on CPAN <http://cpan.org>. (The installer will
try to install these if the make process failes)

  Term::ReadKey
  Term::ANSIScreen
  Term::ANSIColor

Unless you have perl 5.8.0 (or newer (?))

  Devel::Symdump

Other modules used where found in the perl 5.6.1 core distribution, if you
have an other version and you are missing modules please check CPAN.
