Help for Zoidberg::Monitor

The monitor subsystem can be used for running applets inside the zoid.
These applets have the following properties:

name: unique name used to identify the applet
event: the event used to trigger the applet
condition: a subroutine which does arbitrary voodoo to decide whether to
return true
action: a subroutine that acts when the condition is true (notify user,
kill process, turn off lights)

To get a list of running applets:
Monitor->list

You can register a new applet using the following syntax:
Monitor->add_applet("foo", "bar" , sub1, sub2)
"foo" a name
"bar" a event
sub1 the condition as perl code
sub2 the action as perl code

example> ->Monitor->add_applet('motz', 'precmd', 'int(rand 6) ? 0: 1', '$_[0]->parent->motz->fortune')

Or delete an applet:
Monitor->delete_applet("foo")
