 Fry: What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us 
   aren't normal. And that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg. He's 
   a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
 Zoidberg: Damn right. 
 Fry: And the professor's a senile amoral crackpot.
 Professor: Oyeeaii. (waves) 
 Fry: Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.

 Zoidberg: Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!

 Fry: What are we going to do? 
 Professor: Duh, I know, let's play the lottery. 
 Amy: No, let's buy internet stock.
 Zoidberg: On margin! Zoidbee wants to buy on margin.
 Hermes: Look at me! I'm invisible.
 Fry: Wait a minute, I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots.
 Bender: Hey, let's go join the Reform party!
 Everyone: Yeah!

 Zoidberg: Muy macho. Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin 
   your drinking water! 
%
 Professor: Anywho, your net suits will let you experience Fry's 
 worm-infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
