Revision history for Zoidberg -- a modular perl shell
<http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net>

     Fr Dec 20 2002
	We decided to make an unstable release since there are lot of fixes since the
	0.04 release, but there is still a lot to do before releasing a stable version.
	The version numbering scheme changed today:
	- odd numbered major _and_ minor numbers will only be used for (unstable) devel versions
	- versions will have only one major and one minor number
	- everything behind the minor number points to (small) bug fixes (like typo's)
	So today we release the 0.1-devel-unstable version, the first stable release
	will be 0.2, we are looking forward to that release :)
