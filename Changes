Revision history for Zoidberg -- a modular perl shell
<http://zoidberg.sourceforge.net>

     Tu Jun 24 2003
 	Releasing 0.3a_pre1 to test the make and release process

     .. Jun 19 2003
	- Added Zoidberg::Error for OO exception handling

     .. Jun 01 2003
	- Added Zoidberg::DispatchTable

     Mo May 12 2003
        - Added support for $CDPATH, upgraded "cd" builtin.

     We May 07 2003
        - Fixed major bugs in make process.

     Su Apr 06 2003
     	- Removed the MOTZ plugin, this was just legacy.
	- Tuned the interface of the FileRoutines module, 
	seems a bit faster now.

     Mo Mar 31 2003
	- Both events and commands are now defined in a plugins config file,
	thus allowing zoidberg to 'wake up' plugins when needed.
	- Commands defined by a plugin are integrated with both the perl syntax
	as with the command syntax variants.

     We Mar 19 2003
	- All plugins now have their own config files. This makes moving plugins 
	around a bit easier.

     Tu Mar 18 2003
	- Config is not dumped on exit any longer, change of mind.
	- The FileRoutines cache now dumps using Storable, this speeds up the
	initialisation.

     Fr Mar 14 2003
	- Added install profiles to make installing from CVS simpler.

0.2b Su Feb 16 2003
	- Module namespace cleaned up for CPAN

0.2  We Feb 12 2003
	- Plugins get loaded on use, not on init, thus reducing the footprint of
	shells running in the background.
	- Exec comand fixed, this solves a lot of bugs.
	- Lots of other small fixes.

     Jan       2003
	- ZoidIPC works over domain sockets, providing transparent objects.
	- Partially rewrote the input buffer, allowing multiple modusses.
	- Vi commands and keybindings are fairly complete (usable).

     Fr Jan 10 2003
	Lets try another approach to Makefile.PL, all make targets now link to
	files in the 'm/targets' directory.
	- We no longer use ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	- Install everything with "make all"
	Try "perl Makefile.PL && make help" for more info.

     We Jan  8 2003
	Making a fresh cvs directory -- this will make the directory structure
	clean and fit for packaging. As a result there will no longer be a 
	separate ProgramFiles package. Also the release scripts etc. have
	been updated to the new structure.

0.1c Mo Jan  5 2003
	Critical bug in t/use_ok.t -- 0.1b won't install on systems without cvs
	modules installed :((
	- Intel now knows "multi set" results -- allowing for more flexability
	- Zoid now waits correctly for foreground jobs

0.1b Tu Dec 31 2002
	Major change in the way pipes are handled so time for a new devel release.
	Also zoid as inlog shell seems to be working.
	- New pipes implementation, you now can use all context types in pipes.
	- Started writing user documentation.
	- Tab expansion more stable, expanding objects works again.
	- More keybindings implemented.
	- More escape codes to use in the prompt.
	- Command line options fixed.
	Prompt respawns to fast at the moment.

0.1  Fr Dec 20 2002
	We decided to make an unstable release since there are lot of fixes since the
	0.04 release, but there is still a lot to do before releasing a stable version.
	The version numbering scheme changed today:
	- odd numbered minor numbers will only be used for (unstable) devel versions
	- versions will have only one major and one minor number for real changes
	- a second minor number points to (small) bug fixes (like typo's)
	So today we release the 0.1-devel-unstable version, the first stable release
	will be 0.2, we are looking forward to that release :)
