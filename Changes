     Wed Apr 14
        - Added Zoidberg::Shell::scalar to make the Z:Shell AUTOLOAD function
	work more DWIM'ish; it isn't perfect but it is pure perl.

     Jan       2003
	- ZoidIPC works over domain sockets, providing transparent objects.

	- Install everything with "make all"
	Try "perl Makefile.PL && make help" for more info.

     We Jan  8 2003
	Making a fresh cvs directory -- this will make the directory structure
	clean and fit for packaging. As a result there will no longer be a 
	separate ProgramFiles package. Also the release scripts etc. have
	been updated to the new structure.

0.1c Mo Jan  5 2003
	Critical bug in t/use_ok.t -- 0.1b won't install on systems without cvs
	modules installed :((

	- More keybindings implemented.
	- More escape codes to use in the prompt.
	- Command line options fixed.
	Prompt respawns to fast at the moment.

0.1  Fr Dec 20 2002
	We decided to make an unstable release since there are lot of fixes since the
	0.04 release, but there is still a lot to do before releasing a stable version.
	The version numbering scheme changed today:
	- odd numbered minor numbers will only be used for (unstable) devel versions
	- versions will have only one major and one minor number for real changes
	- a second minor number points to (small) bug fixes (like typo's)
	So today we release the 0.1-devel-unstable version, the first stable release
	will be 0.2, we are looking forward to that release :)
